The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. If we make changes, we will revise the date at the top of this page and, in the case of material changes, we will provide you with additional notice if required by applicable law. Unless otherwise stated, the current version of this Privacy Policy applies to all Digital Properties and all personal information under our control.

                <h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
                <p>We take our responsibility to secure the information we collect and maintain seriously. We use reasonable security, including technical, physical and administrative controls, to secure the information we collect and maintain. However, we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose information. You can help protect the privacy of your own information by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized interception of your personal information. You are responsible for the security of your information that you transmit to us or view, download, or otherwise access when using unencrypted, public or otherwise unsecured networks.

                <h3>Information Retention</h3>
                <p>We will retain your personal information at least as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including to satisfy our legal or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed under law. We reserve the right to retain your personal information to the extent allowed by applicable law. We also reserve the right to provide access to or delete personal information only to the extent required by applicable law.</p>

                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of personal information; the potential risk from deletion, unauthorized use, or disclosure of the personal information; the purpose(s) for which we use or may use the personal information; whether we can achieve the purpose(s) through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

                <p>If we de-identify information, we will maintain and use the information in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the information except as required or permitted by law.</p>
